# 32-bit-Bi-Directional-Counter-Interfaced-with-Picorv32-RISC-V-
This project showcases a simple custom System-on-Chip (SoC) design based on the PicoRV32 RISC-V  processor integrated with bi-directional counter . The counter supports both up-counting and down-counting, controlled via firmware to the memory address 0x40000004. The current 32-bit counter value can be read from address 0x40000000.
